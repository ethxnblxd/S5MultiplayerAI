# S5MultiplayerAI

`S5MultiplayerAI` is a script that is focused on recreating the AI Player Logic to make it more realistic and humanlike then the one currently used ingame developed by BlueByte, and will be compatable to be used as a mod via [kimichura's MP Server](https://discord.gg/PVNRnrhANd) on **CSinglePlayer** and **Multiplayer** modes only, the script will replace players ingame that are not connected to actual players with AI Players.

<br>

Keep in mind that this is currently not affiliated with the mp server, if the mod doesnt get accepted to be added to server like the "RandomChaos" and "MPW" mods, i will create a way to download and use this mod/script in game as an external mod.

**NOTE:** this project is currently being developed still, when it is finished you will be able to download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/ethxnblxd/S5MultiplayerAI/releases) page.
